## Turn code into mac app
- Push code to github
- Pull on mac and create jar there (main class: Main.java)
- Open 'Jar2App', add the jar, a ICNS Icon, and output folder, and create the app

## Plan
- Game class with all setups, date, opponent, players
- Use Game to create files that can be opened with WaubenWissel to revisit games
- Full screen logic
- Change team logic
- Fix changing spots after full setup is made (switch between field/bench and then check thingy broken)
- Move to next screen after second setup is done
- Fix dates visual
